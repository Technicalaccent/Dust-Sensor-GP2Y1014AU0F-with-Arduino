# [How Does the GP2Y1014AU0F Dust Sensor Work and How to Interface it with Arduino]



<br>
<br>
When we are talking about air pollution, dust and smoke are one of the many reasons for air pollution. Not only that, in recent years due to climate change, wildfires have become more frequent. A recent report from National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) reported a total of 58,733 wildfires across the US that had burned more than 7.13 million acres in 2021 alone. That is why in this article we are going to Interface the GP2Y1014AU0F Dust Sensor with Arduino to add basic particle sensing to our project. But let's be real, this sensor is not as good as the nova SDS110 Sensor that can measure PM2.5 and PM10 in the air. However, for the price of only 5$ or approx 400Rs, it can't be beaten.
